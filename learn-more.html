      <h2 class="learn-more-headline-1">Who are the teams presenting?</h2>
      <p class="learn-more-paragraph-1-1">
        Every team is a volunteer group of researchers seeking to find funding for their projects, and seeking to share what they are working on with the world. They are motivated, passionate engineers who want to inspire others, and to follow their dreams. Some of them are post-doc researchers, and a few are even high-school seniors. Several universities around the globe are being represented and have formed clubs around this event, where most of our teams are drawn from.
</p>
      
      <h2 class="learn-more-headline-2">What technologies will be revealed?</h2>
      <div class="learn-more-left-img shadow">
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/721b7642-f9ec-4355-a057-269e3acc9462/engine-1609017_640.jpg?v=1657558930556" alt="rocket engine in shadow"/>
      </div>
      <p class="learn-more-paragraph-2-1">
    Groundbreaking research has taken place on various beamed-propulsion systems and reusable rocket launchers, all with a different underlying breakthrough mechanism to help reduce the expense of, and wear and tear on, their corresponding launch vehicles and infrastructure. 
      </p>
      <p class="learn-more-paragraph-2-2">
        A common theme occuring among these technologies is the need for a smaller, more powerful launch technology to reduce the cost of the launch system, sending smarter and smaller payloads to orbit.
</p>
        <h2 class="learn-more-headline-3">What are some of the breakthroughs that have been made?</h2>
          <h3 class="learn-more-subheadline-3-1">Nuclear Isomer Propulsion</h3>
        <p class="learn-more-paragraph-3-1-1">A team from the University of Sharpsburg has synthesized a nuclear isomer of hafnium that stores more energy than chemical fuel, without the disadvantages or risks of conventional nuclear fuel. 
  </p>
      <div class="learn-more-right-img shadow">
        <img src="https://cdn.glitch.global/721b7642-f9ec-4355-a057-269e3acc9462/nasa-4756607_640.jpg?v=1657558956038" alt="rocket engine in light"/>
      </div>
      <p class="learn-more-paragraph-3-1-2">It releases its energy by being stimulated by a compact neutron source based on the Farnsworth Fusor, providing its heat to a heat exchanger that causes the rocket to expel propellant with a specific impulse far higher than conventional chemical launchers. This allows for a small, compact, and economical orbital launch vehicle. 
  </p>
      <h3 class="learn-more-subheadline-3-2">
            Photonic Confinement Energy Storage
      </h3>
        <p class="learn-more-paragraph-3-2-1">        An industrial engineer from Dalton, Virginia and two of his co-workers discovered the persistence of an optical signal in a closed-loop fiber optic circuit that could be amplified from the outside before decaying. Based on their calculations, they can store optical energy in this system that exceeds the energy density of chemical fuels for a few hours. They are now working on developing an orbital thermal rocket prototype powered by this breakthrough photonic confinement technology.

      <h3 class="learn-more-subheadline-3-3">
            Nuclear-Pumped Laser Propulsion
      </h3>
        <p class="learn-more-paragraph-3-3-1">Nuclear engineers from the University of Winchester have developed a nuclear-pumped laser that is capable of focusing its energy on
the heat exchanger on the outside of a rocket, powering it into orbit with steam propellant. By keeping the power source on the ground, it results in a far lighter and smaller launch vehicle that only needs to carry a modest amount of water propellant.
