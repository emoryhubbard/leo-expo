      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever wondered what the future of space travel holds? That future is being built now. Bold and bright engineers are dreaming of the first affordable technology to get into space and they want to share their dreams with the world at the LEO Expo. They're showcasing their work to help inspire the planet and win the Expo prize to fund their dreams. We want to build a website to help them sell tickets to fund the event and spread awareness. They need people to come. This website is the solution.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The target audience is space travel enthusiasts, male and
female, ranging from high school senior (17-19) to college
grad (22-39). Many space travel enthusiasts are even above or below these age ranges. We want the site to cater to anyone interested in space travel and help encourage them to pursue their passions and learn more about the future of spce travel through attending this unique event. We also want to provide a place for those interested in being presenters to contact us. This latter audience would generally consist of somewhat older individuals, but there is significant overlap in age since a lot of college grads will also be attendees.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Anybody  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        The distinctive Klint font was used in the design of the website logo because of its unique, tall and thin lettering which went well with the orbital theme of the expo. This is a font which also has a similar style. In this case it will be thicker variant to aid readability. <!-- change this -->
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Cabin  <!-- change this -->
      </h4>
      <p>
        This font was chosen for the website because it is versatile, highly readable, and has a flavor of personality that goes well with the Anybody font.  <!-- change this -->

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example

        Inventing the Future of Space Travel section
        Bold and bright engineers are dreaming of the first affordable technology to get into space. The current level of technology for launching spacecraft to orbit would have astounded earlier generations, and what the future holds is greater than fiction. Jules Vernes imagined sending a handful of men to the Moon with guncotton in the 1800s. Today's engineers are imagining systems that can be used to colonize the solar system, by transporting anyone to orbit and beyond for an affordable price.</p>
        
        <p>Get a Vision of the Future section 
        Various scientists from all over the world want to share their dreams and designs for space travel at the LEO Expo.
        They're showcasing their work to help inspire the planet and win the Expo prize--a research grant--to fund their dreams. At the Expo, you can meet, listen, and see their visions in a world-class indoor exposition. Each team has their own booths and virtual demonstrations of the technology they are developing.
      </p>
        
        <p>Get Your Ticket and Join the Vision section
        An unforgettable experience awaits you at the LEO Expo. Become a part of history by watching the next era of space travel unfold before your eyes. The event will take place inside the Washington D.C. Convention Center, starting October 1st, open daily from 4 to 9 pm. They need you to come and help spread awareness. The price of your ticket funds the advertising for the event and the research grant.

        Who are the teams presenting?
        Every team is a volunteer group of researchers seeking to find funding for their projects, and seeking to share what they are working on with the world. They are motivated, passionate engineers who want to inspire others, and to follow their dreams. Some of them are post-doc researchers, and a few are even high-school seniors. Several universities around the globe are being represented and have formed clubs around this event, where most of our teams are drawn from.</p>
        
        <p>What technologies will be revealed?
        Groundbreaking research has taken place on various beamed-propulsion systems and reusable rocket launchers, all with a different underlying breakthrough mechanism to help reduce the expense of, and wear and tear on, their corresponding launch vehicles and infrastructure. A common theme occuring among these technologies is the need for a smaller, more powerful launch technology to reduce the cost of the launch system, sending smarter and smaller payloads to orbit.</p>
        
        <p>What are some of the breakthroughs that have been made?
      </p>
        
        <p>
          Nuclear Isomer Propulsion
        
        A team from the University of Sharpsburg has synthesized a nuclear isomer of hafnium that stores more energy than chemical fuel, without the disadvantages or risks of conventional nuclear fuel. It releases its energy by being stimulated by a compact neutron source based on the Farnsworth Fusor, providing its heat to a heat exchanger that causes the rocket to expel propellant with a specific impulse far higher than conventional chemical launchers. This allows for a small, compact, and economical orbital launch vehicle.
        
      </p>
        <p>Photonic Confinement Energy Storage
        
        An industrial engineer from Dalton, Virginia and two of his co-workers discovered the persistence of an optical signal in a closed-loop fiber optic circuit that could be amplified from the outside before decaying. Based on their calculations, they can store optical energy in this system that exceeds the energy density of chemical fuels for a few hours. They are now working on developing an orbital thermal rocket prototype powered by this breakthrough photonic confinement technology.
          
      </p>
        <p>
        Nuclear-Pumped Laser Propulsion
        
        Nuclear engineers from the University of Winchester have developed a nuclear-pumped laser that is capable of focusing its energy on
the heat exchanger on the outside of a rocket, powering it into orbit with steam propellant. By keeping the power source on the ground, it results in a far lighter and smaller launch vehicle that only needs to carry a modest amount of water propellant.
